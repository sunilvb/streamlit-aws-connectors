Accessing Amazon Redshift from outside the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) requires a combination of network and security settings to ensure both accessibility and security. Here are the detailed steps to achieve this:

1. **Create a Redshift Cluster in a VPC**:
    - If you don't already have a Redshift cluster, create one within an Amazon VPC. When creating the cluster, make sure it's launched within a VPC security group.

2. **Modify VPC Security Group Rules**:
    - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard within the AWS Management Console.
    - In the left-hand sidebar, click on "Security Groups".
    - Find and select the security group associated with your Redshift cluster.
    - In the bottom pane, navigate to the "Inbound rules" tab.
    - Click "Edit inbound rules".
    - Add a new rule with the following settings:
        - Type: `Redshift`
        - Protocol: `TCP`
        - Port range: `5439` (default port for Redshift)
        - Source: Depending on your need, you can provide:
            - `Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)`: This allows access from any IP, but it's risky from a security standpoint.
            - Your specific IP address: This is safer as it allows only your IP to connect.
    - Click "Save rules".

3. **Modify Redshift Cluster to be Publicly Accessible**:
    - Go to the Redshift dashboard in the AWS Management Console.
    - Select your cluster.
    - In the cluster details page, click on the "Cluster" dropdown and select "Modify".
    - Ensure that the "Publicly accessible" option is set to `Yes`.
    - Save the changes.

4. **Enable Necessary Network Routes**:
    - If your Redshift cluster is in a private subnet, ensure that the subnet has the necessary route to the internet, typically via a NAT Gateway or NAT Instance.

5. **Use SSL for Connections**:
    - For security, always connect to your Redshift cluster using SSL. Most client tools, like SQL Workbench/J, allow you to specify SSL for connections.

6. **Connecting to Redshift**:
    - Use your preferred SQL client tool (e.g., SQL Workbench/J, DBeaver, etc.).
    - Use the Redshift cluster's endpoint as the hostname.
    - Specify port `5439` (unless you've changed it).
    - Use the database name, username, and password you've set up for your Redshift cluster.
    - If using SSL, specify the path to the Redshift SSL certificate, which you can download from Amazon's documentation.

7. **Consider Using Amazon Redshift Spectrum**:
    - If you're trying to query data in S3 from outside the VPC, you can use Redshift Spectrum. This allows you to run Redshift SQL queries against data in S3 without having to load it into Redshift first.

8. **Regularly Review Access Logs and Monitoring**:
    - Regularly review your VPC Flow Logs and Redshift logs to monitor who is accessing your cluster, especially if it's publicly accessible.

9. **Regularly Update Security Group Rules**:
    - Periodically review and update your security group rules to remove any unnecessary or outdated rules.

Remember, while making a Redshift cluster publicly accessible allows for easier connections from outside the VPC, it also exposes the cluster to potential threats. Always use SSL, limit the IPs that can connect using security groups, and regularly review access patterns to ensure the security of your data.
